## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TaskManagerApp.git
cd task_manager
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up PostgreSQL Database

Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running. Then, create a database and user for the application:

1. Open PostgreSQL:
   ```bash
   psql -U postgres
   ```

2. Inside the `psql` prompt, create the database and user:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE task_manager_db;
   CREATE USER task_user WITH PASSWORD 'yourpassword';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE task_manager_db TO task_user;
   ```

3. Exit `psql` by typing `\q`.

4. Update `app.py` to match the database credentials if they differ.

### 4. Initialize the Database Table

Run the following SQL commands in `psql` to create the `task` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE task (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(100),
    description TEXT,
    priority VARCHAR(10),
    status VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'Pending'
);
```

### 5. Run the Application

Start the Flask app:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

### 6. Open the Application

Once the server is running, open your browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) to access the Task Manager app.

## Usage

### Task Operations

1. **Add a Task**: Fill out the form at the top of the page and click "Add Task."
2. **Edit a Task**: Click "Edit" next to a task, modify the fields, and click "Add Task" to save changes.
3. **Delete a Task**: Click "Delete" next to a task to remove it.

## API Endpoints

The Task Manager app includes the following API endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint         | Description              |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| GET    | `/task`         | Retrieve all tasks       |
| POST   | `/task`         | Add a new task           |
| PUT    | `/task/<id>`    | Update a task by ID      |
| DELETE | `/task/<id>`    | Delete a task by ID      |

### Example API Requests

Using `curl`, you can test each endpoint:

- **Add a Task**:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/task -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Buy groceries", "description": "Milk, Bread, Eggs", "priority": "High"}'
  ```

- **Get All Tasks**:
  ```bash
  curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/task
  ```

- **Update a Task**:
  ```bash
  curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5000/task/1 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Grocery Shopping", "description": "Milk, Bread, Eggs, Butter", "priority": "High", "status": "In Progress"}'
  ```

- **Delete a Task**:
  ```bash
  curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5000/task/1
  ```
